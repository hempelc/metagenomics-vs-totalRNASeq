# Version 0.2, made on 27 Aug 2020 by Chris Hempel (hempelc@uoguelph.ca)

# Takes R1 and R2 reads, performs FastQC on the raw reads, then, if specified,
# trims them using Trimmomatic with a list of PHRED scores and performs FastQC
# on all trimmed read sets

# FastQC must be installed and in path

# A folder with adapters to trim must be located in the same folder as the
# trimmomatic .jar application and called "adapters" (that's usually the case
# when you install trimmomatic).
# For now, the used adapter sequences are fixed and can be changed in line 122

# The limit of the PHRED score is 38.

usage="$(basename "$0") -1 <R1.fastq> -2 <R2.fastq> -t <yes|no> [-T <path/to/trimmomatic.jar> -P <'score score score ...'> -l <length> -p <threads>]

Usage:
	-1  Reads1 (can also be .gz compressed)
	-2  Reads2 (can also be .gz compressed)
	-t	yes: trim reads (needs -T specified); no: don't trim reads
	-T  Path to trimmomatic java application (.jar)
	-P  PHRED scores to trim on (default: '5 10 15 20' (numbers must be surrounded by ' ' and separated only by space); based on recommendations of MacMarnes 2014 and a literature review of papers that cite them)
	-l  Minimum read length to keep (default: 25 , based on recommendations of MacMarnes 2014 and a literature review of papers that cite them)
	-p  Number of threads used	(default: 16)
	-h  Display this help and exit"
