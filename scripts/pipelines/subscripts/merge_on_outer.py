# A simple script to merge two files on columns that exist in both files, keeps
# all rows, and adds 0 for read counts if a contig has no mapped reads.
# Needs to have a column 'counts' with readcounts in the readcount file.
# If the first file is empty, the script merges on the column sequence_name and
# keeps the column order that way.

# Usage: ./merge_files.py file2 file2 output_file_name
